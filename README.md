This project is a simple calculator built using Python as part of my internship project for the CodSoft Virtual Summer Internship Program (June 2025). It performs basic arithmetic operations through a clean and interactive interface.

The calculator allows users to:

• 🔢 Input two numbers

• ➕ Select an arithmetic operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)

• 🧠 Perform the calculation based on the selected operation

• 📟 Display the result on the screen


🔧 Technologies Used:

• Python – Programming language used to implement logic

• tkinter – Used to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface)

➕ Supported Operations:

• ➕ Addition (+)

• ➖ Subtraction (-)

• ✖️ Multiplication (*)

• ➗ Division (/)

• 🔢 Exponentiation (**)

• 🧮 Floor Division (//)
